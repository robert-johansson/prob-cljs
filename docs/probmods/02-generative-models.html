<p>One view of knowledge is that the mind maintains working models of parts of the world. &lsquo;Model&rsquo; in the sense that it captures some of the structure in the world, but not all (and what it captures need not be exactly what is in the world&mdash;just useful). &lsquo;Working&rsquo; in the sense that it can be used to simulate this part of the world, imagining what will follow from different initial conditions. As an example take the Plinko machine: a box with uniformly spaced pegs, with bins at the bottom. Into this box we can drop marbles.</p>

<canvas id="plinkocanvas-intro" width="10" height="10" style="background-color:#333333;"></canvas>
<button onclick="initPlinko('plinkocanvas-intro'); this.style.display='none';">Drop a marble!</button>

<p>The Plinko machine is a &lsquo;working model&rsquo; for many physical processes in which many small perturbations accumulate&mdash;for instance a leaf falling from a tree. It is an approximation to these systems because we use a discrete grid (the pegs) and discrete bins. Yet it is useful as a model: for instance, we can ask where we expect a marble to end up depending on where we drop it in, by running the machine several times&mdash;simulating the outcome.</p>

<p>Simulation is intimately connected to degrees of belief. For instance, imagine that someone has dropped a marble into the Plinko machine; before looking at the outcome, you can probably report how much you believe that the ball has landed in each possible bin. Indeed, if you run the Plinko machine many times, you will see a shape emerge in the bins. The number of balls in a bin gives you some idea how much you should expect a new marble to end up there. This &lsquo;shape of expected outcomes&rsquo; can be formalized as a probability distribution (described below). Indeed, there is an intimate connection between simulation and probability, which we explore in the rest of this section.</p>

<p>There is one more thing to note about our Plinko machine above: we are using a computer program to <em>simulate</em> the simulation. Computers can be seen as universal simulators. How can we, clearly and precisely, describe the simulation we want a computer to do?</p>

<h1 id="building-generative-models"><a href="#building-generative-models">Building Generative Models</a></h1>

<p>We wish to describe in formal terms how to generate states of the world. That is, we wish to describe the causal process, or steps that unfold, leading to some potentially observable states. The key idea of this section is that these generative processes can be described as <em>computations</em>&mdash;computations that involve random choices to capture uncertainty about the process.</p>

<p>As our formal model of computation we use the &lambda;-calculus, embodied in the Lisp family of programming languages. The &lambda;-calculus is a formal system invented by Alonzo Church in 1936 as a way of formalizing the notion of an effectively computable function (Church, 1936). It has only two basic operations: creating and applying functions. Despite this simplicity, it is a <em>universal</em> model of computation&mdash;conjectured to be equivalent to all other notions of classical computation. (The &lambda;-calculus was shown to have the same computational power as the Turing machine, and vice versa, by Alan Turing in his famous paper which introduced the Turing machine (Turing, 1937).)</p>

<p>We use ClojureScript, a modern Lisp that runs in the browser. Like Scheme and Church before it, ClojureScript provides a clean syntax for &lambda;-calculus-style programming. Probabilistic primitives are provided by prob-cljs, a library that adds random primitives and inference to standard ClojureScript. This combination gives us a powerful language for describing generative models.</p>

<p>In addition to deterministic functions, we have a set of random functions implementing <em>random choices</em>. These random primitive functions are called <em>Exchangeable Random Primitives</em> (XRPs). Application of an XRP results in a <em>sample</em> from the probability distribution defined by that XRP. For example, the simplest XRP is <code>flip</code> which results in either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>&mdash;it simulates a (possibly biased) coin toss:</p>

<pre><code>(flip)</code></pre>

<p>Run this program a few times. You will get back a different sample on each execution. Also, notice the parentheses around <code>flip</code>. These are meaningful; they tell ClojureScript that you are asking for an application of the XRP <code>flip</code>&mdash;resulting in a sample. Without parentheses <code>flip</code> is a <em>function</em> object&mdash;a representation of the simulator itself, which can be used to get samples.</p>

<p>Each time you run a program you get a <em>sample</em> by simulating the computations and random choices that the program specifies. If you run the program many times, and collect the values in a histogram, you can see what a typical sample looks like:</p>

<pre><code>(hist (repeatedly 1000 flip) "Flips")</code></pre>

<p>Here we have used the <code>repeatedly</code> function which takes a number of repetitions, K, and a random function (in this case <code>flip</code>) and returns a list of K samples from that distribution. We have used the <code>hist</code> function to display the results of taking 1000 samples from <code>flip</code>. As you can see, the result is an approximately uniform distribution over <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>An important idea here is that <code>flip</code> can be thought of in two different ways. From one perspective, <code>flip</code> is a function which returns a sample from a fair coin. That is, it&rsquo;s a <em>sampler</em> or <em>simulator</em>. From another perspective, <code>flip</code> is <em>itself</em> a characterization of the distribution over <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. When we think about probabilistic programs we will often move back and forth between these two views, emphasizing either the sampling perspective or the distributional perspective. We return to this relationship between probability and simulation below.</p>

<p>The <code>flip</code> function is the simplest XRP in prob-cljs, but you will find other XRPs corresponding to familiar probability distributions, such as <code>gaussian</code>, <code>gamma</code>, <code>dirichlet</code>, and so on. Using these XRPs we can construct more complex expressions that describe more complicated sampling processes. For instance here we describe a process that samples a number by multiplying two samples from a Gaussian distribution:</p>

<pre><code>(* (gaussian 0 1) (gaussian 0 1))</code></pre>

<p>What if we want to invoke this sampling process multiple times? We would like to construct a stochastic function that multiplies two Gaussians each time it is called. We can use <code>fn</code> to construct such complex stochastic functions from the primitive ones:</p>

<pre><code>(def two-gaussians (fn [] (* (gaussian 0 1) (gaussian 0 1))))
(density (repeatedly 100 two-gaussians) "two-gaussians")</code></pre>

<p>An <code>fn</code> expression with an empty argument list, <code>(fn [] ...)</code>, is called a <em>thunk</em>: this is a function that takes no input arguments. If we apply a thunk (to no arguments!) we get a return value back, for example <code>(flip)</code>. A thunk is an object that represents a whole <em>probability distribution</em>. Complex functions can also have arguments. Here is a stochastic function that will only sometimes double its input:</p>

<pre><code>(defn noisy-double [x] (if (flip) x (+ x x)))
(noisy-double 3)</code></pre>

<p>By using higher-order functions we can construct and manipulate probability distributions. A good example comes from coin flipping&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="example-flipping-coins"><a href="#example-flipping-coins">Example: Flipping Coins</a></h2>

<p>The following program defines a fair coin, and flips it 20 times:</p>

<pre><code>(def fair-coin (fn [] (if (flip 0.5) 'h 't)))
(hist (repeatedly 20 fair-coin) "fair coin")</code></pre>

<p>This program defines a &ldquo;trick&rdquo; coin that comes up heads most of the time (95%), and flips it 20 times:</p>

<pre><code>(def trick-coin (fn [] (if (flip 0.95) 'h 't)))
(hist (repeatedly 20 trick-coin) "trick coin")</code></pre>

<p>The higher-order function <code>make-coin</code> takes in a weight and outputs a function (a thunk) describing a coin with that weight. Then we can use <code>make-coin</code> to make the coins above, or others:</p>

<pre><code>(defn make-coin [weight] (fn [] (if (flip weight) 'h 't)))
(def fair-coin (make-coin 0.5))
(def trick-coin (make-coin 0.95))
(def bent-coin (make-coin 0.25))
(hist (repeatedly 20 fair-coin) "20 fair coin flips")
(hist (repeatedly 20 trick-coin) "20 trick coin flips")
(hist (repeatedly 20 bent-coin) "20 bent coin flips")</code></pre>

<p>We can also define a higher-order function that takes a &ldquo;coin&rdquo; and &ldquo;bends&rdquo; it:</p>

<pre><code>(defn make-coin [weight] (fn [] (if (flip weight) 'h 't)))
(defn bend [coin]
  (fn [] (if (= (coin) 'h)
           ((make-coin 0.7))
           ((make-coin 0.1)))))
(def fair-coin (make-coin 0.5))
(def bent-coin (bend fair-coin))
(hist (repeatedly 100 bent-coin) "bent coin")</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you understand how the <code>bend</code> function works! Why are there an &ldquo;extra&rdquo; pair of parentheses outside each <code>make-coin</code> call?</p>

<p>Higher-order functions like <code>repeatedly</code>, <code>map</code>, and <code>apply</code> can be quite useful. Here we use them to visualize the number of heads we expect to see if we flip a weighted coin (weight = 0.8) 10 times. We&rsquo;ll repeat this experiment 1000 times and then use <code>hist</code> to visualize the results. Try varying the coin weight or the number of repetitions to see how the expected distribution changes.</p>

<pre><code>(def make-coin (fn [weight] (fn [] (flip weight))))
(def coin (make-coin 0.8))
(def data (repeatedly 1000 (fn [] (sum (map (fn [x] (if x 1 0)) (repeatedly 10 coin))))))
(hist data "Distribution of coin flips")</code></pre>

<h1 id="example-causal-models-in-medical-diagnosis"><a href="#example-causal-models-in-medical-diagnosis">Example: Causal Models in Medical Diagnosis</a></h1>

<p>Generative knowledge is often <em>causal</em> knowledge that describes how events or states of the world are related to each other. As an example of how causal knowledge can be encoded in probabilistic programs, consider a simplified medical scenario:</p>

<pre><code>(def lung-cancer (flip 0.01))
(def cold (flip 0.2))
(def cough (or cold lung-cancer))
cough</code></pre>

<p>This program models the diseases and symptoms of a patient in a doctor&rsquo;s office. It first specifies the base rates of two diseases the patient could have: lung cancer is rare while a cold is common, and there is an independent chance of having each disease. The program then specifies a process for generating a common symptom of these diseases&mdash;an effect with two possible causes: the patient coughs if they have a cold or lung cancer (or both).</p>

<p>Here is a more complex version of this causal model:</p>

<pre><code>(def lung-cancer (flip 0.01))
(def TB (flip 0.005))
(def stomach-flu (flip 0.1))
(def cold (flip 0.2))
(def other (flip 0.1))
(def cough (or (and cold (flip 0.5)) (and lung-cancer (flip 0.3)) (and TB (flip 0.7)) (and other (flip 0.01))))
(def fever (or (and cold (flip 0.3)) (and stomach-flu (flip 0.5)) (and TB (flip 0.1)) (and other (flip 0.01))))
(def chest-pain (or (and lung-cancer (flip 0.5)) (and TB (flip 0.5)) (and other (flip 0.01))))
(def shortness-of-breath (or (and lung-cancer (flip 0.5)) (and TB (flip 0.2)) (and other (flip 0.01))))
(list "cough" cough "fever" fever "chest-pain" chest-pain "shortness-of-breath" shortness-of-breath)</code></pre>

<p>Now there are four possible diseases and four symptoms. Each disease causes a different pattern of symptoms. The causal relations are now probabilistic: only some patients with a cold have a cough (50%), or a fever (30%). There is also a catch-all disease category &ldquo;other&rdquo;, which has a low probability of causing any symptom. <em>Noisy logical</em> functions, or functions built from <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>flip</code>, provide a simple but expressive way to describe probabilistic causal dependencies between Boolean (true&ndash;false valued) variables.</p>

<p>When you run the above code, the program generates a list of symptoms for a hypothetical patient. Most likely all the symptoms will be false, as (thankfully) each of these diseases is rare. Experiment with running the program multiple times. Now try modifying the <code>def</code> statement for one of the diseases, setting it to be true, to simulate only patients known to have that disease. For example, replace <code>(def lung-cancer (flip 0.01))</code> with <code>(def lung-cancer true)</code>. Run the program several times to observe the characteristic patterns of symptoms for that disease.</p>

<h1 id="prediction-simulation-and-probabilities"><a href="#prediction-simulation-and-probabilities">Prediction, Simulation, and Probabilities</a></h1>

<p>Suppose that we flip two fair coins, and return the list of their values:</p>

<pre><code>(list (flip) (flip))</code></pre>

<p>How can we predict the return value of this program? For instance, how likely is it that we will see <code>(true false)</code>? A <strong>probability</strong> is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses the answer to such a question: it is a degree of belief that we will see a given outcome, such as <code>(true false)</code>. The probability of an event \(A\) (such as the above program returning <code>(true false)</code>) is usually written as: \(P(A)\).</p>

<p>As we did above, we can sample many times and examine the histogram of return values:</p>

<pre><code>(defn random-pair [] (list (flip) (flip)))
(hist (repeatedly 1000 random-pair) "return values")</code></pre>

<p>We see by examining this histogram that <code>(true false)</code> comes out about 25% of the time. We may define the <strong>probability</strong> of a return value to be the fraction of times (in the long run) that this value is returned from evaluating the program&mdash;then the probability of <code>(true false)</code> from the above program is 0.25.</p>

<p>Even for very complicated programs we can predict the probability of different outcomes by simulating (sampling from) the program. It is also often useful to compute these probabilities directly by reasoning about the sampling process.</p>

<h2 id="product-rule"><a href="#product-rule">Product Rule</a></h2>

<p>In the above example we take three steps to compute the output value: we sample from the first <code>(flip)</code>, then from the second, then we make a list from these values. To make this more clear let us re-write the program as:</p>

<pre><code>(def A (flip))
(def B (flip))
(def C (list A B))
C</code></pre>

<p>We can directly observe (as we did above) that the probability of <code>true</code> for <code>A</code> is 0.5, and the probability of <code>false</code> from <code>B</code> is 0.5. Can we use these two probabilities to arrive at the probability of 0.25 for the overall outcome <code>C</code> = <code>(true false)</code>? Yes, using the <em>product rule</em> of probabilities: the probability of two random choices is the product of their individual probabilities. The probability of several random choices together is often called the <em>joint probability</em> and written as \(P(A,B)\). Since the first and second random choices must each have their specified values in order to get <code>(true false)</code> in the example, the joint probability is their product: 0.25.</p>

<p>We must be careful when applying this rule, since the probability of a choice can depend on the probabilities of previous choices. For instance, compute the probability of <code>(true false)</code> resulting from this program:</p>

<pre><code>(def A (flip))
(def B (flip (if A 0.3 0.7)))
(list A B)</code></pre>

<p>In general, the joint probability of two random choices \(A\) and \(B\) made sequentially, in that order, can be written as \(P(A,B) = P(A) \cdot P(B|A)\). This is read as the product of the probability of \(A\) and the probability of &ldquo;\(B\) given \(A\)&rdquo;, or &ldquo;\(B\) conditioned on \(A\)&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the probability of making choice \(B\) given that choice \(A\) has been made in a certain way. Only when the second choice does not depend on (or &ldquo;look at&rdquo;) the first choice does this expression reduce to a simple product of the probabilities of each choice individually: \(P(A,B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)\).</p>

<p>What is the relation between \(P(A,B)\) and \(P(B,A)\), the joint probability of the same choices written in the opposite order? The only logically consistent definitions of probability require that these two probabilities be equal, so \(P(A) \cdot P(B|A) = P(B) \cdot P(A|B)\). This is the basis of <em>Bayes&rsquo; theorem</em>, which we will encounter later.</p>

<h2 id="sum-rule-or-marginalization"><a href="#sum-rule-or-marginalization">Sum Rule or Marginalization</a></h2>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s consider an example where we can&rsquo;t determine from the overall return value the sequence of random choices that were made:</p>

<pre><code>(or (flip) (flip))</code></pre>

<p>We can sample from this program and determine that the probability of returning <code>true</code> is about 0.75.</p>

<p>We cannot simply use the product rule to determine this probability because we don&rsquo;t know the sequence of random choices that led to this return value. However we can notice that the program will return <code>true</code> if the two component choices are <code>true, true</code>, or <code>true, false</code>, or <code>false, true</code>. To combine these possibilities we use another rule for probabilities: if there are two alternative sequences of choices that lead to the same return value, the probability of this return value is the sum of the probabilities of the sequences. We can write this using probability notation as: \(P(A) = \sum_B P(A,B)\), where we view \(A\) as the final value and \(B\) as a random choice on the way to that value. Using the product rule we can determine that the probability in the example above is 0.25 for each sequence that leads to return value <code>true</code>, then, by the sum rule, the probability of <code>true</code> is \(0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75\).</p>

<p>Using the sum rule to compute the probability of a final value is called <em>marginalization</em>. From the point of view of sampling processes marginalization is simply ignoring (or not looking at) intermediate random values that are created on the way to a final return value. From the point of view of directly computing probabilities, marginalization is summing over all the possible &ldquo;histories&rdquo; that could lead to a return value. Putting the product and sum rules together, the marginal probability of return values from a program is the sum over sampling histories of the product over choice probabilities&mdash;a computation that can quickly grow unmanageable, but can be approximated by sampling.</p>

<h1 id="stochastic-recursion"><a href="#stochastic-recursion">Stochastic recursion</a></h1>

<p>Recursive functions are a powerful way to structure computation in deterministic systems. In probabilistic programming it is possible to have a <em>stochastic</em> recursion that randomly decides whether to stop. For example, the <em>geometric distribution</em> is a probability distribution over the non-negative integers. We imagine flipping a (weighted) coin, returning \(N-1\) if the first <code>true</code> is on the \(N\)th flip (that is, we return the number of times we get <code>false</code> before our first <code>true</code>):</p>

<pre><code>(defn geometric [p]
  (if (flip p) 0 (+ 1 (geometric p))))
(hist (repeatedly 1000 (fn [] (geometric 0.6))) "Geometric of 0.6")</code></pre>

<p>There is no upper bound on how long the computation can go on, although the probability of reaching some number declines quickly as we go. Indeed, stochastic recursions must be constructed to halt eventually (with probability 1).</p>

<h1 id="persistent-randomness-mem"><a href="#persistent-randomness-mem">Persistent Randomness: <code>mem</code></a></h1>

<p>It is often useful to model a set of objects that each have a randomly chosen property. For instance, describing the eye colors of a set of people:</p>

<pre><code>(defn eye-color [person] (uniform-draw '(blue green brown)))
(list (eye-color 'bob) (eye-color 'alice) (eye-color 'bob))</code></pre>

<p>The results of this generative process are clearly wrong: Bob&rsquo;s eye color can change each time we ask about it! What we want is a model in which eye color is random, but <em>persistent</em>. We can do this using another primitive: <code>mem</code>. <code>mem</code> is a higher-order function that takes a function and produces a <em>memoized</em> version of it. When a stochastic function is memoized, it will sample a random value the <em>first</em> time it is used for some arguments, but return that same value when called with those arguments thereafter. The resulting memoized function has a persistent value within each &ldquo;run&rdquo; of the generative model (or simulated world). For instance consider the equality of two flips, and the equality of two memoized flips:</p>

<pre><code>(= (flip) (flip))</code></pre>

<pre><code>(def mem-flip (mem flip))
(= (mem-flip) (mem-flip))</code></pre>

<p>Now returning to the eye color example, we can represent the notion that eye color is random, but each person has a fixed eye color:</p>

<pre><code>(def eye-color (mem (fn [person] (uniform-draw '(blue green brown)))))
(list (eye-color 'bob) (eye-color 'alice) (eye-color 'bob))</code></pre>

<p>This type of modeling is called <em>random world</em> style (McAllester, Milch, &amp; Goodman, 2008). Note that we don&rsquo;t have to specify ahead of time the people whose eye color we will ask about: the distribution on eye colors is implicitly defined over the infinite set of possible people, but only constructed &ldquo;lazily&rdquo; when needed. Memoizing stochastic functions thus provides a powerful toolkit to represent and reason about an unbounded set of properties of an unbounded set of objects. For instance, here we define a function <code>flip-n</code> that encodes the outcome of the <em>n</em>th flip of a particular coin:</p>

<pre><code>(def flip-n (mem (fn [n] (flip))))
(list (list (flip-n 1) (flip-n 12) (flip-n 47) (flip-n 1548))
      (list (flip-n 1) (flip-n 12) (flip-n 47) (flip-n 1548)))</code></pre>

<p>There are a countably infinite number of such flips, each independent of all the others. The outcome of each, once determined, will always have the same value.</p>

<p>In computer science memoization is an important technique for optimizing programs by avoiding repeated work. In the probabilistic setting memoization actually affects the <em>meaning</em> of the memoized function.</p>

<h1 id="example-bayesian-tug-of-war"><a href="#example-bayesian-tug-of-war">Example: Bayesian Tug of War</a></h1>

<p>Imagine a game of tug of war, where each person may be strong or weak, and may be lazy or not on each match. If a person is lazy they only pull with half their strength. The team that pulls hardest will win. We assume that strength is a continuous property of an individual, and that on any match, each person has a 25% chance of being lazy. This program runs a tournament between several teams, mixing up players across teams. Can you guess who is strong or weak, looking at the tournament results?</p>

<pre><code>(def strength (mem (fn [person] (gaussian 0 1))))
(defn lazy [person] (flip 0.25))
(defn pulling [person] (if (lazy person) (/ (strength person) 2) (strength person)))
(defn total-pulling [team] (sum (map pulling team)))
(defn winner [team1 team2] (if (< (total-pulling team1) (total-pulling team2)) team2 team1))
(list "Tournament results:"
      (winner '(alice bob) '(sue tom))
      (winner '(alice bob) '(sue tom))
      (winner '(alice sue) '(bob tom))
      (winner '(alice sue) '(bob tom))
      (winner '(alice tom) '(bob sue))
      (winner '(alice tom) '(bob sue)))</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <code>strength</code> is memoized because this is a property of a person true across many matches, while <code>lazy</code> isn&rsquo;t. Each time you run this program, however, a new &ldquo;random world&rdquo; will be created: people&rsquo;s strengths will be randomly re-generated, then used in all the matches.</p>

<h1 id="example-intuitive-physics"><a href="#example-intuitive-physics">Example: Intuitive physics</a></h1>

<p>Humans have a deep intuitive understanding of everyday physics&mdash;this allows us to make furniture, appreciate sculpture, and play baseball. How can we describe this intuitive physics? One approach is to posit that humans have a generative model that captures key aspects of real physics, though perhaps with approximations and noise. This mental physics simulator could for instance approximate Newtonian mechanics, allowing us to imagine the future state of a collection of (rigid) bodies.</p>

<p>We have included such a 2-dimensional physics simulator (via Matter.js). The function <code>run-physics</code> takes a collection of physical objects and runs physics &lsquo;forward&rsquo; by some amount of time. We also have <code>animate-physics</code>, which does the same, but gives us an animation to see what is happening. We can use this to imagine the outcome of various initial states, as in the Plinko machine example above:</p>

<p>There are many judgments that you could imagine making with such a physics simulator. Hamrick, Battaglia, &amp; Tenenbaum (2011) have explored human intuitions about the stability of block towers. Look at several different random block towers; first judge whether you think the tower is stable, then simulate to find out if it is:</p>

<pre><code>(def x-center (/ js/worldWidth 2))
(defn get-width [obj] (first (nth (vec (first obj)) 2)))
(defn get-height [obj] (second (nth (vec (first obj)) 2)))
(defn get-x [obj] (first (second obj)))
(defn get-y [obj] (second (second obj)))
(def ground (list (list "rect" true (list js/worldWidth 10)) (list (/ js/worldWidth 2) js/worldHeight)))
(defn dim [] (uniform 10 50))
(defn xpos-block [prev] (uniform (- (get-x prev) (get-width prev)) (+ (get-x prev) (get-width prev))))
(defn ypos-block [prev h] (- (get-y prev) (get-height prev) h))
(defn add-block [prev first?]
  (let [w (dim) h (dim)]
    (list (list "rect" false (list w h)) (list (if first? x-center (xpos-block prev)) (ypos-block prev h)))))

  (let [b1 (add-block ground true) b2 (add-block b1 false) b3 (add-block b2 false) b4 (add-block b3 false) b5 (add-block b4 false)]
    (list ground b1 b2 b3 b4 b5)))

<p>Were you often right? Were there some cases of &lsquo;surprisingly stable&rsquo; towers? Hamrick et al. (2011) account for these cases by positing that people are not entirely sure where the blocks are initially (perhaps due to noise in visual perception). Thus our intuitions of stability are really stability given noise (or the expected stability marginalizing over slightly different initial configurations). We can realize this measure of stability as:</p>

(defn get-height [obj] (second (nth (vec (first obj)) 2)))

<p>Here are three programs:</p>
<pre><code>(if (flip) (flip 0.7) (flip 0.1))</code></pre>
<pre><code>(flip (if (flip) 0.7 0.1))</code></pre>
<pre><code>(flip 0.4)</code></pre>
<p>a) Show that the marginal distribution on return values for these three programs is the same by directly computing the probability using the rules of probability (hint: write down each possible history of random choices for each program). Check your answers by sampling from the programs.</p>
<p>b) Explain why these different-looking programs can give the same results.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Explain why (in terms of the evaluation process) these two programs give different answers (i.e. have different distributions on return values):</p>
<pre><code>(def foo (flip))
(list foo foo foo)</code></pre>
<pre><code>(defn foo [] (flip))
(list (foo) (foo) (foo))</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the simple medical diagnosis example we imagined a generative process for the diseases and symptoms of a single patient. If we wanted to represent the diseases of many patients we might have tried to make each disease and symptom into a function from a person to whether they have that disease, like this:</p>
<pre><code>(defn lung-cancer [person] (flip 0.01))
(defn cold [person] (flip 0.2))
(defn cough [person] (or (cold person) (lung-cancer person)))
(list (cough 'bob) (cough 'alice))</code></pre>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t this work correctly if we try to do the same thing for the more complex medical diagnosis example? How could we fix it?</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Work through the evaluation process for the <code>bend</code> higher-order function in this example:</p>
<pre><code>(defn make-coin [weight] (fn [] (if (flip weight) 'h 't)))
(defn bend [coin] (fn [] (if (= (coin) 'h) ((make-coin 0.7)) ((make-coin 0.1)))))
(def fair-coin (make-coin 0.5))
(def bent-coin (bend fair-coin))
(hist (repeatedly 100 bent-coin) "bent coin")</code></pre>
<p>Directly compute the probability of the bent coin returning <code>h</code>. Check your answer by comparing to the histogram of many samples.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Here is a modified version of the tug of war game. Instead of drawing strength from the continuous Gaussian distribution, strength is either 5 or 10 with equal probability. Also the probability of laziness is changed from 1/4 to 1/3. Here are four expressions you could evaluate using this modified model:</p>
<pre><code>(def strength (mem (fn [person] (if (flip) 5 10))))
(defn lazy [person] (flip (/ 1 3)))
(defn total-pulling [team]
  (sum (map (fn [person] (if (lazy person) (/ (strength person) 2) (strength person))) team)))
(defn winner [team1 team2] (if (< (total-pulling team1) (total-pulling team2)) team2 team1))

(winner '(alice) '(bob))                         ;; expression 1
;(= '(alice) (winner '(alice) '(bob)))           ;; expression 2
;(and (= '(alice) (winner '(alice) '(bob)))      ;; expression 3
;     (= '(alice) (winner '(alice) '(fred))))
;(and (= '(alice) (winner '(alice) '(bob)))      ;; expression 4
;     (= '(jane) (winner '(jane) '(fred))))</code></pre>
<p>a) Write down the sequence of expression evaluations and random choices that will be made in evaluating each expression.</p>
<p>b) Directly compute the probability for each possible return value from each expression.</p>
<p>c) Why are the probabilities different for the last two? Explain both in terms of the probability calculations you did and in terms of the &ldquo;causal&rdquo; process of evaluating and making random choices.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use the rules of probability, described above, to compute the probability that the geometric distribution defined by the following stochastic recursion returns the number 5.</p>
<pre><code>(defn geometric [p] (if (flip p) 0 (+ 1 (geometric p))))</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Convert the following probability table to a compact prob-cljs program:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>P(A,B)</th></tr>
<tr><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>0.14</td></tr>
<tr><td>false</td><td>true</td><td>0.06</td></tr>
<tr><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>0.4</td></tr>
<tr><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>0.4</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Hint: fix the probability of <code>A</code> and then define the probability of <code>B</code> to <em>depend</em> on whether <code>A</code> is true or not. Run your program and build a histogram to check that you get the correct distribution.</p>
<pre><code>(def a ...)
(def b ...)
(list a b)</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the intuitive physics section above we modeled stability of a tower as the probability that the tower falls when perturbed, and we modeled &ldquo;falling&rdquo; as getting shorter. It would be reasonable to instead measure <em>how much shorter</em> the tower gets.</p>
<p>a) Below, modify the stability model by writing a continuous measure, <code>tower-fall-degree</code>. Make sure that your continuous measure is in some way numerically comparable to the discrete measure, <code>does-tower-fall</code> (defined here as either 0 or 1). Mathematically, what is your continuous measure?</p>
